   <p class="maintextU" id="section-1">The Negative</p>
   <p class="maintext">In Ceron, the negative is a rather obscure, and complicated thing, and there is no simple way to express it. I’ve actually come up with a new word to describe how the negative is expressed in Ceron.The word used is called “Sovarity”. Sovarity essentially describes how serious, or to what extent of negation you are trying to get across. In Ceron, there is 3 levels of Sovarity which we use to express negation. Here, all explain all 3 levels and how to use them.</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><b>(Verb) - u a</b></p>
   <p class="maintext">This negation form has the lowest level of Sovarity. Meaning that it describes the lowest amount of “the negative”. To understand exactly what that means, you have to think about it a little bit differently from the English “negative”. In Ceron, this negation form can only be applied to verbs and gives the impression that you aren't doing that verb often, regularly, or part of your daily life. It can almost translate to “I'm not usually doing X”, although it's not the same, because you can use this form in the present tense to describe what in English would be “I am not doing X”. If the end of the verb ends with a vowel,remove the last vowel and then attach “u a”.
   Take this sentence for example.</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ymaha abodu a</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm not drinking water / I don't drink water</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Thananasa abudenu a</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">He is not talking to her at school / He doesn't talk to her at school</p>
   <p class="maintext">Although this sentence translates as “I’m not drinking water” in English, in Ceron, this sentence actually has a much more complex meaning which takes further understanding. The sentence above, using the -u a negation signifies that you are not only specifically not drinking water in this moment, but you also don't drink water usually. In this form, the emphasis is not put on the fact that you are not drinking water in this exact moment, but more on the fact that habitually, you don't often drink water. This is why it has low Sovarity. I also want to mention that this negation form is actually two grammar princples in one, the “u” turns the verb into a noun, and the “a” is the shortened version of the next negation concept I will teach you, “ha”.</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><b>(Verb) - ya/a</b></p>
   <p class="maintext">This next negation form has the second most amount of Sovarity, and is the negation form you will find most often used in daily life and novels. Now, in order to add this form to a verb, all you need to do is attach “ya” to the end of said verb if it ends with a vowel, and “a” if it ends with a consonant. Here are some examples.</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ymaha aboda</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm not drinking water</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ymamona saya</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm not going home</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Thananasa sacona abudena</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">He is not talking to her at school</p>
   <p class="maintext">This form is rather simple, and has no hidden nuance. It simply states that you are not doing said action right now. The reason why this has the second most amount of Sovarity and not the most, is because the next negation form implies that you are not doing X now, and will not do X.</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><b>Ba - (Verb)</b></p>
   <p class="maintext">I won't go too in depth into this form as I will explain it better later on, but essentially, this negation form has the highest level of Sovarity, and gives the impression that you are not doing X, and will not (ever) do X. It has a strong sense of commitment, and should not be used lightly as it is almost like a promise. Here is an example.</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ythanasa ba aysa</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I dont, and will never love him</p>
   <p class="maintext">Also remember that the verb “to be” (a), is extremely irregular when turning it into the negative state. Here is “a” in all levels of Sovarity.</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>SV 1 CANNOT BE USED WITH THE VERB TO BE</i></p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>SV 2 - Ydenaya</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I am not a person</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>SV 3 - Ydena ba (a)</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I am not a person</p>
   <p class="maintextU" id="section-2">To Have</p>
   <p class="maintext">Up until now, I haven’t really talked about the verb “to have” in Ceron, which is quite a unique verb compared to the rest</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><b>Somer</b></p>
   <p class="maintext67">To have</p>
   <p class="maintext">Now, the reason why I haven't talked about the verb “to have” yet, is because the verb in Ceron is far more complex than it is in English. For now though, let’s just look at its most simple, and common meaning, which mimics that of English’s. Before that though, know that the verb “to have” in Ceron, has both a NP (somer) and P form (a somer) which we use depending on the meaning we are trying to convey. Here are respective sentences each with a different version of the verb “to have”. Note though, that somer is irregularly conjugated within sentences. Whenever the word before somer ends with a vowel, attach “s” to the end of it. (This rule also applies to the particle “a” which indicates a physical verb). When the word ends with a consonant, the last consonant is not pronounced.</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Narma gala assomer</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">We have a small dog (holding in your hands)</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Narma galas somer</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">We have a small dog (In general, not holding)</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Erasmadas somer</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">They have money (Carrying the money)</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Erasmad somer</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">They have money (In a bank, not carrying it)</p>
   <p class="maintext">In the first sentence, “E marep gala as somer”, the verb “to have” in its P form is used. In this form, the verb “somer”, translates more as “I am carrying a small dog” instead of “I have a small dog”, despite the fact that “somer” technically means “to have” in English. However in the second sentence, “E marep galas somer” it translates more as “I have a dog”. Whenever you attach “a” before the verb “somer” in Ceron, it turns the sentence into a very literal meaning, and so is more accurately described as “carrying” or “holding” opposed to “having”.</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ysharona gala assomer</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm holding a nice dog</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ysharona galas somer</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I have a nice dog</p>
   <p class="maintext">It is important to know when to use the P form of “somer”, as it can sometimes come off strange if you were to use the wrong form in the wrong context…</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ycana mamas somer</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I have a kind mom</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ycana mama assomer</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm carrying my kind mom(?)</p>
   <p class="maintextU" id="section-3">To Like</p>
   <p class="maintext">In Ceron, the verb “to like” actually has many different meanings which change depending on how you use it in a sentence! Here are four of the most common meanings of “sharon” in Ceron.</p>
   <p class="maintext87">Sharona</p>
   <p class="maintext67">To like (Verb)</p>
   <p class="maintext87">Sharona</p>
   <p class="maintext67">Nice (Adjective)</p>
   <p class="maintext87">Sharona</p>
   <p class="maintext67">Pretty (Adjective)</p>
   <p class="maintext87">Sharona</p>
   <p class="maintext67">Favourite (Adjective)</p>
   <p class="maintext">Now, the reason why I’m bringing up “sharon” right now, despite the fact I have used it in previous examples, is because “sharon” is both an adjective, and verb in Ceron. Although this might seem confusing to Native-English speakers, this is actually quite common in some languages (Such as Korean). To show how “sharon” can be used as both an adjective and verb, here are some examples. It’s also important to remember that “sharon” has many different meanings which change according to the listener's interpretation.</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Negala sharona</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">My dog is pretty</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Une sharona annara</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">You are my favourite girl</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Lasharona aupara</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">This is a nice car</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Lamamon sharona</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I like this house</p>
    <p class="maintext">Creating the negative with “sharon” is the same like with any other verb</p>
    <p class="maintext87"><i>Ygon sharona</i></p>
    <p class="maintext67">I like fruit</p>
    <p class="maintext87"><i>Ygon sharonaya</i></p>
    <p class="maintext67">I dont like fruit</p>
   <p class="maintext">Remember that the verb “sharon” can never act on its own as a verb, it must always be accompanied by “a” at the end.</p>
