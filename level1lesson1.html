   <h2 class="borderexample">Ceronec Script and Basic Syllables</h2>
   <p class="maintext">The Ceronec alphabet is comprised of 26 letters, most of which can be found in English. The Ceronec alphabet (Busræ) was designed to represent all the sounds in the Ceronec language although some vowel letters such as a,e,i,o and u may sometimes represent two distinct but similar sounding sounds. The list below represents all the current letters in the Ceronec alphabet alongside their phonetic sound represented by both an English equivalent and their designated IPA symbol. (This list appears in the official order of letters)</p>
   <p class="maintext">Here are the 20 letters divided into vowels and consonants without pronounciation: </p>
   <p class="maintextceron">ch th f b l p v w m s h r n c d g</p>
   <p class="maintextceron">a e u o</p>
   <p class="maintext">The following is the first set of letters. The 16 consonants along with their approximate English equivalent: </p>
   <p class="maintext87">F</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'F' as in 'Fire' | /f/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">B</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'B' as in 'Bin' | /b/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">L</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'L' as in 'Let' (When last in a syllable, your tongue should end at the top of your mouth) | /l/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">P</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'P' as in 'Pet' | /p/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">V</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'V' as in 'Valve' | /v/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">V</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'W' as in 'Way' | /w/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">M</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'M' as in 'Map' | /m/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">S</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'S' as in 'Sit' | /s/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">H</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'H' as in 'Horrible' | /ħ/ OR 'H' as in 'Happy' | /h/ OR Silent </p>
   <p class="maintext87">R</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'R' as in 'Curd' (In Scottish accent, rolled R as in Spanish) | /r/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">N</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'N' as in 'Neck' | /n/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">C</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'Shr' no English equivalent. Say 'sh' but add a 'r' after. The 'r' sound should be coming from the back of your mouth. The word 'carenas' being pronounced as 'Shrarnas' | /ʃɾ/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">D</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'D' as in 'Dick' (Hard d, almost t/th) | /d/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">K</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'K' as in 'Cook' | /k/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">T</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'T' as in 'Time' | /t/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">Y</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'Y' as in 'You' | /j/</p>
   <p class="maintext87">þ</p>
   <p class="maintext67">'Th' as in 'Though, Their, The and That' | /θ/ and /ð/</p>
   <p class="maintext">
*(Although this letter is romanized as ‘c’, the sound it represents is of one not found in English. The most common way to write this sound is ‘shr’ although later on an audio file pronouncing the letter will be included.)
</p>
   <p class="maintext">In my opinon, the best way to memorise the pronounciation of words is to just listen to the audio file provided instead of trying to associate each Ceronec letter with an English letter as the pronounciation will never be 100% correct.
   Its important to remember that the pronounciation of Ceronec words is vastly different than that of English words. For example, the 'r' sound in Ceron can either be pronouced by rolling or by letting the tongue touch the top of the mouth and rolling it gently while not allowing it to leave.
 Either way, this 'r' is not found in English. You'll also find though, that there are many sounds in English which are not found in Ceron.</p>
 <p class="maintext">With that out of the way, here are the 4 basic vowels in Ceron.</p>
  <p class="maintextceron2">a<span class="maintextwith">= a</span></p>
  <p class="maintextceron2">e<span class="maintextwith">= e</span></p>
  <p class="maintextceron2">u<span class="maintextwith">= u</span></p>
  <p class="maintextceron2">o<span class="maintextwith">= o</span></p>
<p class="maintext">Notice that in Ceron the sound 'i' does not exist. There is also a distinct differentiation in style compared to the consonants, with most vowels being written simple and vertically.</p>
<p class="maintext">Hooray, you now know the 20 basic letters in Ceron. From this, you can create very simple words and syllables. First though, you have to know how to place consonants and vowels together to create sounds; thankfully though, its quite simple.
In order to create sounds or syllables in Ceron, all you need to do is place them beside eachother. (Like in English). For example, lets create some basic CV sounds: </p>
<p class="maintextceron2">ra<span class="maintextwith">= 'ra'</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">re<span class="maintextwith">= 're'</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">ru<span class="maintextwith">= 'ru'</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">ro<span class="maintextwith">= 'ro'</span></p>
<p class="maintext">You can also create CVC syllables.</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">ram<span class="maintextwith">= 'ram'</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">thad<span class="maintextwith">= 'thad'</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">com<span class="maintextwith">= 'com/shrom'</span></p>
<p class="maintext">Or CCV, VVC, VCV etc</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">abwa<span class="maintextwith">= 'abwa'</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">aads<span class="maintextwith">= 'aads'</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">eda<span class="maintextwith">= 'eda'</span></p>
<p class="maintext">Although none of these sound combinations mean anything, they serve as building blocks to create more complex words and sounds in the future.</p>
<p class="maintext">From this moment on, its best to stop relying on the romanization of words and just listen to the audio files or learn the correct pronounciation without the aid of Latin letters.</p>
