   <p class="maintext">Congrats! You've made it to lesson 14. Thank you for continuing to learn Ceron! Now, before I begin, I want to note that as you progress further and further through the lessons, you might find that some grammar concepts might contradict what you learned in the past. This is true, and will happen more and more. This is because earlier in the lessons it would have been too complicated to explain exactly why each grammar concept is as it is. Fortunately though, from this lesson on, I will be explaining all complicated grammar concepts instead of leaving them for later on. Now, without further ado, let's get into lesson 14!</p>
   <p class="maintext">Adverbsâ€¦ What are adverbs? Adverbs are words that describe how you do a verb. Simple right? Examples of some English adverbs are Quickly, Swiftly, Angrily, Sadly, Strangely etc. Most adverbs (maybe even all) in English end with -ly which makes it quite easy to spot out adverbs. In Ceron, adverbs are formed from verbs and nouns with the addition of -vi added to the end of them. Here are some examples of that</p>
   <p class="maintext87">Brran</p>
   <p class="maintext67">Terror, Fear</p>
   <p class="maintext87">Brranvi</p>
   <p class="maintext67">Frightfully, To do something with Fear</p>
   <p class="maintext87">Callad</p>
   <p class="maintext67">Secret</p>
   <p class="maintext87">Calladvi</p>
   <p class="maintext67">Secretly, To do something with Secret</p>
   <p class="maintext">Now even though almost every noun can be turned into an adverb with the addition of -vi at the end, they are not always seen as the most intelligent or sophisticated of words.</p>
   <p class="maintext87">Brran</p>
   <p class="maintext67">Terror, Fear</p>
   <p class="maintext87">Brranvi</p>
   <p class="maintext67">Frightfully, To do something with Fear</p>
   <p class="maintext87">Aurmn, Ancau</p>
   <p class="maintext67">Frightfully, To do something with Fear</p>
   <p class="maintext">Those last two adverbs, Aurmn and Ancau, might be seen as the more sophisticated choice of words in a very professional setting even though in everyday life you would actually sound very strange using those words.</p>
