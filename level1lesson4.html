   <h2 class="borderexample">Construction of Ceronec words</h2>
   <p class="maintext">As you progress through the levels, you'll start noticing that almost all words in Ceron bare no resemblance to that of words in English. This is for many reasons, but
   the main one being that Ceron is considered a Priori Conlang, meaning that the majority of its vocabulary is not based on a natural language. Despite it sounding like one, Ceron is not a Germanic language.
 It might seem discouraging that most words in Ceron bare no resemblance to words in English. However, if you understand the many prefixes and suffixes of Ceron, you will start to understand that most words
have logical meaning behind them. This lesson is not necessary to continue and is more just for people who are curious and want a better understanding of the language. This lesson might be long.</p>
   <p class="maintext">To understand words, we first need to understand ancient words and what they meant. The ancient Ceronec people were very mythological and had many gods representing different forces of nature and planets.
   Many modern words today derive from these ancient words for gods. One of the most famous examples of this is the word for 'Moon': (Romanizations will not be included in this lesson)</p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">outheon<span class="maintextwith">Moon, God of the moon</span></p>
   <p class="maintext">This word has 5 main 'children words'.</p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">outhfartha<span class="maintextwith">Astronaut</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">outhgum<span class="maintextwith">Astronomy</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">outhma<span class="maintextwith">Waves</span></p>
   <p class="maintext">Here is another example.</p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">oren<span class="maintextwith">Rain, God of the water</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">oren<span class="maintextwith">To rain</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">orenuarn<span class="maintextwith">Umbrella</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">orence<span class="maintextwith">Clear blue ocean</span></p>
   <p class="maintext">And another.</p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">than<span class="maintextwith">He, him</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">thanden<span class="maintextwith">Male</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">thangar<span class="maintextwith">Brother</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">thanmare<span class="maintextwith">Boyfriend</span></p>
   <p class="maintext">All these words have ancient origins and are actually hard for native speakers to pronounce. The word meaning 'waves' is actually a compound word, which leads me into the next section of Ceronec word construction.</p>
   <p class="maintext">A lot of words in Ceron are considered compound words. Some examples of words which are attached to the end of other words are:</p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">den<span class="maintextwith">Meaning 'person'</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">con<span class="maintextwith">Meaning 'realted to education'</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">son<span class="maintextwith">Meaning 'room'</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">lare<span class="maintextwith">Meaning 'room or court of law'</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">eon<span class="maintextwith">Uncertain meaning</span></p>
   <p class="maintext">These words, or, suffixes can be seen in many words in modern Ceron, such as:</p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">annden<span class="maintextwith">Woman</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">thanden<span class="maintextwith">Man</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">archden<span class="maintextwith">Sailor or captain</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">burden<span class="maintextwith">To speak</span></p>
   <p class="maintextceron2">barden<span class="maintextwith">Clothesless person</span></p>
   <p class="maintext">The suffix -den is one of the most used endings in all of Ceron and comes from the word 'denare' meaning person, human or man.</p>
<p class="maintext">Here are some examples of words ending in -con, denoting something related to education.</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">ancon<span class="maintextwith">Student</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">macon<span class="maintextwith">School class</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">sacon<span class="maintextwith">School</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">dareancon<span class="maintextwith">Highschool</span></p>
<p class="maintext">Words in Ceron sometimes will have the same root word even when their meaning doesnt exactly relate. This is because over time the meaning of words has changed but the spelling hasnt, leading to words relating to eachother in spelling and origin but not in meaning. Such as:</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">thrar<span class="maintextwith">Uncertain meaning although something like 'together, community or list'</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">thrargad<span class="maintextwith">District</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">thrarmenare<span class="maintextwith">Community</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">thrarsare<span class="maintextwith">University</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">thrarn<span class="maintextwith">Border</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">thrarou<span class="maintextwith">Company</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">thrarum<span class="maintextwith">Chapter (of a book)</span></p>
<p class="maintext">There are 3 other suffixes which can be attached to literally any word in Ceron to alter its meaning, those suffixes are:</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">garn<span class="maintextwith"></span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">esd<span class="maintextwith"></span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">cesd<span class="maintextwith"></span></p>
<p class="maintext">Lets talk about the first one. The first suffix traditionally turns verbs and adjectives into nouns. However nowadays, the suffix can be attached to just create a new word whether it be a noun or verb is irrelevant. Here's an example: </p>
<p class="maintextceron2">aach<span class="maintextwith">To grow</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">aachgarn<span class="maintextwith">Improvement</span></p>
<p class="maintext">The suffix is sometimes compared with -ment or -tion in English although I wouldn't say that. See this for example:</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">aera<span class="maintextwith">Sound</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">aeragarn<span class="maintextwith">Atmosphere of sound, ambience</span></p>
<p class="maintext">Now lets talk about the second suffix. This suffix is essentially the Ceronec equivalent of -er or -ist in English. (Not 100% true). The same goes for the third suffix -cesd. The difference is minimal, usally though, you will find -cesd after words that end in vowels not consonants.
You can attach these suffixes to verbs, nouns, adjectives etc.</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">cana<span class="maintextwith">Unkind</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">canacesd<span class="maintextwith">Someone who brings down the mood</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">ahanage<span class="maintextwith">Mortgage</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">ahanagesd<span class="maintextwith">Broker</span></p>
<p class="maintext">The last type of suffix you can add to words (not really the last but the last one I will discuss for now) is -a, which is the shortned form of -ha, denoting the negative. Adding this to the end of a word flips the meaning of said word. (Sometimes the suffix may be written as -ha.) Examples:</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">baden<span class="maintextwith">To take control (by force)</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">Badena<span class="maintextwith">To loose control (unwillingly)</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">aach<span class="maintextwith">To grow</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">aacha<span class="maintextwith">To rot</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">aera<span class="maintextwith">Sound</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">aeraha<span class="maintextwith">To turn off, silence</span></p>
