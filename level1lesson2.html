   <h2 class="borderexample">Additional Letters and Diphthongs</h2>
   <p class="maintext">In the previous lesson you learned the Basic 20 letters, here, you will learn the rest. The additional letters in the Ceronec script were actually added after the original 20 were made. The additional letters allow Ceron to be written shorter and nicer-looking; turning common two letter sounds into one letter.
   You will find that almost every letter in Ceron has an altered version with 'r' attached to it and every vowel except 'u' has 'n' attached to it. Here is the list of new letters which you should learn. After memorising this, you will have the
     ability to read any Ceronec word.</p>
<p class="maintext">First, lets look at the 'r' ending letters. (Consonants only).</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">chr<span class="maintextwith">= chr</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">thr<span class="maintextwith">= thr</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">fr<span class="maintextwith">= fr</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">br<span class="maintextwith">= br</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">pr<span class="maintextwith">= pr</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">nr<span class="maintextwith">= nr</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">dr<span class="maintextwith">= dr</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">gr<span class="maintextwith">= gr</span></p>
<p class="maintext">Seeing this, you'll notice that a lot of letters do not have a 'r' variant. This is because of irregular pronounciation rules and other factors. There are a few irregular letters which do not fall under any specific category and those are:</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">sh<span class="maintextwith">= sh</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">vrn<span class="maintextwith">= vrn</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">rn<span class="maintextwith">= rn</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">sd<span class="maintextwith">= sd</span></p>
<p class="maintext">Let's use these letters in some examples.</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">grad<span class="maintextwith">= 'grad'</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">throm<span class="maintextwith">= 'throm'</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">shad<span class="maintextwith">= 'shad'</span></p>
<p class="maintext">In addition to these consonant letters, there are multiple diphthongs or vowel combination letters in Ceron which are used very frequently and will allow you to create real words finally. Those letters are: (I will introduce each letter individually, beginning with the 'r' ending vowels.)</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">ar<span class="maintextwith">= ar</span></p>
<p class="maintext">This is an extremely important letter and will allow you to create many words. The 'r' in this word is always rolled.</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">er<span class="maintextwith">= er</span></p>
<p class="maintext">Once again a very important letter but the 'r' here is often not rolled.</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">ur<span class="maintextwith">= ur</span></p>
<p class="maintext">This letter is not used as frequently as 'er' and 'ar'. Overtime, this letter's pronounciation has also become less distinct, with the sound shifting closer to that of the next letter 'or'. The 'r' here is sometimes rolled and sometimes not.</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">or<span class="maintextwith">= or</span></p>
<p class="maintext">This letter too is not as frequent as the others but alas is still used. The 'r' here is almost never rolled although there are exepctions.</p>
<p class="maintext">The next set of letters end in the letter 'n'. These are some of the most used letters in all of Ceron.</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">an<span class="maintextwith">= an</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">en<span class="maintextwith">= en</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">on<span class="maintextwith">= on</span></p>
<p class="maintext">You'll notice that there is no letter representing 'un' here.</p>
<p class="maintext">The last set of letters are the irregular ones which dont fit into any category really.</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">oe<span class="maintextwith">= oe</span></p>
<p class="maintext">Although this letter is romanized as 'oe' the sound is closer to 'eo' and sometimes makes a 'yo' sound.</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">ae<span class="maintextwith">= ae</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">ue<span class="maintextwith">= ue</span></p>
<p class="maintext">Both 'ae and 'ue' are infrequently used letters and are often used solely for grammar. Around a year ago there was a spelling reform (which is still going on now) which involved the erasure of the dipthong 'ae' with many words changing it to 'a'.</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">our<span class="maintextwith">= our</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">aer<span class="maintextwith">= aer</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">eur<span class="maintextwith">= eur</span></p>
<p class="maintext">With these last few letters out of the way, you can finally write all the words imaginable in Ceron. Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">wa<span class="maintextwith">= na (wa)</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">affranve<span class="maintextwith">= affranvi (affranve)</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">cae<span class="maintextwith">= sae (cae)</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">cardentha<span class="maintextwith">= kardentha (cardentha)</span></p>
<p class="maintext">But wait a minute... If you had remembered all the letters, you would know that the way I romanized them is different from how they are 'supposed' to be pronounced! Yes, this is true, these are examples of the many irregular pronounciations in Ceron.
There is no way to truly predict them (hence irregular) so it's best to just listen to the audio when learning any word that has v,w or c in it. However, I can help you with some irregulars as there are a few which have rules to their madness. For example: </p>
<p class="maintextceron2">affranve<span class="maintextwith">= affranvi (affranve) (hesitantly)</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">caradve<span class="maintextwith">= karadvi (caradve) (secretly)</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">bednave<span class="maintextwith">= bednavi (bednave) (to do something with humour)</span></p>
<p class="maintext">Whenever 've' appears at the end of a word its never pronounced as 'veh' but as 'vi'.</p>
<p class="maintext">Another rule to remember is that whenever 'wa' appears on its own, its pronounced as 'na'. It also might be confusing to some people how one letter can represent two very different sounds:</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">cae<span class="maintextwith">= sae (cae) (Inn)</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">cardentha<span class="maintextwith">= kardentha (cardentha) (To understand or to agree)</span></p>
<p class="maintext">Both of these words begin with the same letter and yet are pronounced completely different. This is because of many reasons but the main one being that Ceronec people dont distinguish between c, k and s. This might seem confusing but if you were to
pronounce 'cardentha' as 'sardentha' or 'shrardentha' the average native speaker would see no difference in pronounciation.</p>
<p class="maintext">These are the most important irregular pronounciation rules. Because you know how to read now, here are some words in Ceron which come from English, read them outloud to see their similarities:</p>
<p class="maintextceron2">fone<span class="maintextwith">= phone</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">coffe<span class="maintextwith">= coffee</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">game<span class="maintextwith">= game</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">rado<span class="maintextwith">= radio</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">careputare<span class="maintextwith">= computer</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">cafe<span class="maintextwith">= cafe</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">hamburger<span class="maintextwith">= hamburger</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">pessa<span class="maintextwith">= pizza</span></p>
<p class="maintextceron2">colar<span class="maintextwith">= color</span></p>
<p class ="maintextend"<li><a class="maintext3t" href="level1lesson3.html">Now that you know all the letters in Ceron, you can now move on to the next lesson.</a></li></p>
