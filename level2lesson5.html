   <p class="maintextU" id="section-1"><u>Greetings</u></p>
   <p class="maintext">Welcome to the first (real) lesson of this Ceronec language guide! The first topic I will be discussing is Greetings. In Ceronec culture, greeting someone (In the conventional sense, like saying hello, goodbye etc) is not as common as it is in English and many other languages. In Ceron, there is no real respect system built into the language, and instead, many people prefer to not greet or say anything to each other on their first meeting. Nevertheless, due to the rising interconnectedness of the world, many old and new greeting words have reemerged for easier conversation between people.</p>
   <p class="maintext">The most common greeting word that you are most likely to hear in everyday life is this one</p>
   <body>

     <script>
       function play() {
         var audio = document.getElementById(audio);
         audio.play();
       }
     </script>

     <p class="maintext87">Belar</p>
     <p class="maintext67">Hello, Hey</p>
     <p class="maintext">This greeting, roughly meaning “Hello” or “Hey” in English, is popular among young, and middle aged men (16-40) and can sometimes come off as a little bit over-masculine and is seldomly used by women. Over the years, this word has experienced much change, some of which, has resulted in the creation of other greeting words such as:</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Bela</p>
     <p class="maintext67">Hello</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Belarnasa</p>
     <p class="maintext67">Hello, Welcome, Good Day</p>
     <p class="maintext">The first greeting, bela, is used primarily by young girls and women as a way to seem less confrontational and more approachable. Although this greeting mostly flourishes among women, as of late, more and more men have been using this greeting as a less-formal alternative to belar. The second greeting, belarnasa, is used when greeting someone into your home (similar to ‘welcome’ in English), and is also used when greeting someone who you respect greatly, like your father, mother, or grandparents. (Similar to Good-day)</p>
     <p class="maintext">This next greeting (or farewell) usually translates as thank you or goodbye in English.</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Feldar or Fera</p>
     <p class="maintext67">Goodbye, Thank you</p>
     <p class="maintext">Both of these exclamations are used by men and women of all ages. Now, you might be wondering, how can thank you and goodbye be the same word? Essentially, whenever you are saying thank you to someone, you are quite literally thanking them for speaking to you and so therefore they (as well as you) should no longer speak after you say this. Now, there are some exceptions, for example, it's common that after saying feldar or fera you can just switch the topic to something else instead of completely exiting the conversation as a whole. This might seem confusing, so for now, just think of feldar as goodbye instead of thank you.</p>
     <p class="maintextU" id="section-2"><u>Word Order</u></p>
     <p class="maintext">Word Order refers to the composition of words in a sentence. In Ceron, the word order is sometimes similar, and sometimes extremely different to that of English. Ceron is considered an SOV language, meaning that the Subject is first, then the Object, and then finally the Verb. Adjectives and adverbs are always placed before the word they modify, and prepositions (technically adpositions in Ceron), are placed after the word they modify. Now, onto the examples. Take this basic SVO sentence in English:</p>
     <span class="maintext87w">I</span><span class="maintext87color">drink</span><span class="maintext87color2"> water</span></p>
     <p class="maintext">This sentence, which is composed of a Subject (I), a Verb (to drink) and an object (water) would change to this using the Word Order in Ceron</p>
     <span class="maintext87w">I</span><span class="maintext87color2">water</span><span class="maintext87color"> drink</span></p>
     <p class="maintext">As you can see, the Subject (I) remains in the same position, whereas the Object (water) and the verb (drink) switches places, with the verb instead coming last. In sentences where just 3 words are present, this switch in order is quite simple to understand, although as sentences get longer, it will become harder to understand if you do not have a strong understanding of the Word Order. Adjectives in Ceron work similarly to that of English ones; they always come before the words they are describing, for example</p>
     <p class="maintext87">The big house</p>
     <p class="maintext87">The small cat</p>
     <p class="maintext87">The pretty person</p>
     <p class="maintext">In Ceron, the composition of all these sentences would be the same (Just without the definite articles since Ceron does not have these)</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Big house</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Small cat</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Pretty person</p>
     <p class="maintext">However, before I jump into making sentences which adjectives in Ceron, you need to learn about one very important grammatical “particle” first.</p>
     <p class="maintextU" id="section-3"><u>a (to be)</u></p>
     <p class="maintext">The translation for “a” in English is usually “to be”, although it has a plethora of other more important functions and uses which can't exactly be translated into one English word. Aside from functioning as the verb to be, it also (in its verb form) functions as an honorific. When you add “a” to the end of a sentence, the sentence becomes more respectable and formal, and so is often added when speaking to teachers, parents, grandparents etc.</p>
     <p class="maintext">However before I talk about its function as the verb “to be”, which is quite simple to understand in Ceron, let’s talk about adjectives, which sadly happen to be a little more complicated to use in sentences.</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Pretty person</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Big house</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Dark horse</p>
     <p class="maintext">All these sentences are very easy to translate into Ceron since they all feature one adjective and one noun. Now although you might be tempted to just plop adjectives in front of nouns in Ceron, there is a little bit of thinking that has to occur beforehand. In Ceron, there are two types of adjectives (as well as verbs) that determine how we link an adjective to a noun. These two classifications are Non-Physical (NP) and Physical (P). P adjectives are adjectives like these</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Big, Small, Rough, Pointy, Curved, Straight etc</p>
     <p class="maintext">Whereas NP adjectives are adjectives like these</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Pretty, Usefull, Confusing, Ugly, Proud, Dark etc (Aswell as all colors)</p>
     <p class="maintext">Essentially, P adjectives are adjectives that you can feel, touch or visually see, and are things that physically define the object at hand. NP adjectives on the other hand, are more ideas, opinions, and things that aren't visual / built into said object. (Most adjectives are NP)</p>
     <p class="maintext">Now how does the classification of an adjective affect how it's connected to a noun you ask? Well, take this sentence for example</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Big House</p>
     <p class="maintext">Exchange the words for Big and House into Ceron which are</p>
     <p class="maintext87"><b>Sa</b></p>
     <p class="maintext67">Big</p>
     <p class="maintext87"><b>Mamon</b></p>
     <p class="maintext67">House</p>
     <p class="maintext">Since “big” in Ceron is considered P adjective, (it defines the object at hand and can be visually seen) nothing is added when linking it to the noun its modifying, which in this case is “house”. So, the phrase “big house” would be as follows</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Sa mamon</p>
     <p class="maintext67">Big house</p>
     <p class="maintext">The adjective is placed directly before the noun with a space inbetween, identical to that of the English composition. Here are some more examples</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Ma gala</p>
     <p class="maintext67">Small dog</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Dena aupar</p>
     <p class="maintext67">Broken car</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Aud naren</p>
     <p class="maintext67">Hot weather</p>
     <p class="maintext">However, this rule changes when you want to modify a noun using a NP adjective. When placing a NP adjective infront of a noun, you must link the adjective to the noun by placing the particle “a” before the noun but after the adjective. (Do note though, that in this situation, “a” is not representing the verb “to be” but instead just the particle “a” which has no meaning on its own). Knowing this, you can now create sentences with NP adjectives. For example</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Dark horse</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Pretty person</p>
     <p class="maintext">(Both “Pretty” and “Dark” in Ceron are considered NP adjectives.) Exchange the words</p>
     <p class="maintext87"><b>Shad</b></p>
     <p class="maintext67">Dark</p>
     <p class="maintext87"><b>Mor</b></p>
     <p class="maintext67">Horse</p>
     <p class="maintext87"><b>Sharon</b></p>
     <p class="maintext67">Pretty</p>
     <p class="maintext87"><b>Dena</b></p>
     <p class="maintext67">Person</p>
     <p class="maintext">Now, apply the rule that we would use when linking NP adjectives to nouns</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Shadamor</p>
     <p class="maintext67">Dark horse</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Sharona dena</p>
     <p class="maintext67">Pretty person</p>
     <p class="maintext">Youll notice that in the first example, the phrase “Dark horse” is turned into one singular word. This often happens with short words (words under 4-5 letters) and cannot be done with longer words (such as the next example). The particle “a” is always attached directly to the adjective without a space regardless of word length. Here are some more examples of NP adjectives in use</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Dagada urun</p>
     <p class="maintext67">Red fox</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Durana nara</p>
     <p class="maintext67">Different country</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Argusya haber*</p>
     <p class="maintext67">Helpful book</p>
     <p class="maintext">Whenver a NP adjective ends with the vowel “a”, the ending (the two last letters) are changed to “ya” when the “a” particle is added, (which better represents how its pronounced.) For example, the actual word for helpful in Ceron is Argusa not Argusya. If an adjective ends with an “o” or “u”, the ending changes to “wa”. Remember this rule.</p>
     <p class="maintext">Now that you know how to construct sentences using P and NP adjectives, we can move on to learning how to use “a” as the verb “to be”. As you know, verbs in Ceron always come last in a sentence/clause, and that rule does not change with the verb “a”. Here are some very simple sentences featuring the verb “a” (to be), a Subject, and an Object</p>
     <span class="maintext87w">Y dena</span><span class="maintext87color">a</span></p>
     <p class="maintext67">I am a person</p>
     <span class="maintext87w">Y ancon</span><span class="maintext87color">a</span></p>
     <p class="maintext67">I am a student</p>
     <span class="maintext87w">Y anna</span><span class="maintext87color">a</span></p>
     <p class="maintext67">I am a woman</p>
     <span class="maintext87w">Y hara dena</span><span class="maintext87color">a</span></p>
     <p class="maintext67">I am a strong person</p>
     <p class="maintext">Easy, right? Unfortunately, none of these sentences are grammatically correct :( Let’s break down each sentence one by one.</p>
     <span class="maintext87w">Y ancon</span><span class="maintext87color">a</span></p>
     <p class="maintext67">I am a student</p>
     <span class="maintext87w">Y anna</span><span class="maintext87color">a</span></p>
     <p class="maintext67">I am a woman</p>
     <p class="maintext">Both of these sentences have one thing in common with eachother, they both start with a vowel. Whenever a word that starts with a vowel is infront of the pronoun “I” (E), the pronoun changes to “Y” and directly attaches to the beginning of said word. Applying this rule, those two sentences would correctly be</p>
     <span class="maintext87w">Yancon</span><span class="maintext87color">a</span></p>
     <p class="maintext67">I am a student</p>
     <span class="maintext87w">Yanna</span><span class="maintext87color">a</span></p>
     <p class="maintext67">I am a woman</p>
     <p class="maintext">Still though, one of these sentences has a problem, and it lies with the verb. In the second example, “I am a woman”, the noun “woman” (anna), ends with a vowel, which is then followed by the verb “to be” (a) which also happens to be a vowel, specifically, the vowel “a”. Whenever this happens, the “a”, which represents the verb “to be”, can be removed from the sentence as a whole, OR, attached to the end of the word directly. The verb “a” also differs from other Ceronec verbs in the sense that it is the only verb that when the word before it ends with a consonant, it is attached directly to the end without a space. (As if it was a copula). So, correctly, all those sentences would be as follows</p>
     <span class="maintext87w">Ydena</span></p>
     <p class="maintext67">I am a person</p>
     <span class="maintext87w">Yancona</span></p>
     <p class="maintext67">I am a student</p>
     <span class="maintext87w">Yanna</span></p>
     <p class="maintext67">I am a woman</p>
     <span class="maintext87w">Yhara dena</span></p>
     <p class="maintext67">I am a strong person</p>
     <p class="maintextU"><u>Demonstrative Determiners</u></p>
     <p class="maintext">In English, we have 4 main demonstrative determiners which are This, That, These and Those. In Ceron, we have 2 main demonstrative determiners which are further compressed into 1 main determiner.</p>
     <p class="maintext87"><b>Lad</b> (before vowels)</p>
     <p class="maintext67">This, That</p>
     <p class="maintext87"><b>La</b> (before consonants)</p>
     <p class="maintext67">This, That</p>
     <p class="maintext">In Ceron, the most common meaning for La and Lad is “This”, and just like how “This” functions in English, it is placed directly before the word it modifies. Even though in English La and Lad are translated as “This”, La and Lad don’t describe distance or quantity and should be more appropriately translated as all 4 determiners in English (That, Those, These, This). When using La and Lad, link them directly onto the front of a word without a space inbetween.</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Lagala</p>
     <p class="maintext67">This dog</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Ladena</p>
     <p class="maintext67">This man</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Ladanna</p>
     <p class="maintext67">This woman</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Lahaber</p>
     <p class="maintext67">This book</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Ladesner</p>
     <p class="maintext67">This waiter</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Lahaber (Pointing at close book)</p>
     <p class="maintext67">This book</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Lahaber (Pointing at far way book)</p>
     <p class="maintext67">That book</p>
     <p class="maintext">You can use “La” and “Lad” in sentences normally, although they almost always appear in the beginning of a clause</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Ladena hara</p>
     <p class="maintext67">This person is strong</p>
     <p class="maintext87">Ladanna ancona</p>
     <p class="maintext67">That woman is a student</p>
