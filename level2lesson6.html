   <p class="maintextU" id="section-1">Using Verbs</p>
   <p class="maintext">Welcome to the second lesson of this Ceron learning guide! In this lesson, I’ll be talking about verbs, as well as some other fun grammar concepts. In Ceron, just like with adjectives, verbs have two different types of classifications, P and NP. (P verbs will be marked in dictionaries with the particle “a” before them, whereas NP verbs with be marked with nothing.)</p>
   <p class="maintext">P verbs are verbs like these</p>
   <p class="maintext87">To drink, To walk, To talk, To touch</p>
   <p class="maintext">Whereas NP verbs are verbs like these</p>
   <p class="maintext87">To be pretty, To think, To look, To lie</p>
   <p class="maintext">As you can see, P verbs are verbs that you can physically do with your body, whereas NP verbs are basically every other verb, or conceptual verbs. This rule, though, is not definite. For example, the verb “to see” (comad), is considered a NP verb in Ceron even though some would debate that “seeing” or “looking” at something is physical. Now, remember how with adjectives you link NP ones to nouns using “a” and not P ones? Well, unfortunately, with verbs it's the opposite. Only P verbs are linked to pronouns, nouns, etc using the same particle “a” (With a little modification). Here’s what I mean</p>
   <p class="maintext87">I drink water</p>
   <p class="maintext">Since “to drink” in Ceron is considered a P verb, you have to link the noun (water) to the verb (to drink) using the particle “a”. This is done by attaching the particle “a” directly onto the end of the noun. If the noun ends with a vowel, a space is left in between, and if a noun ends with a consonant, there is no space in between. Since the word for water (maha) in Ceron ends with a vowel, there is a space between the noun and the particle “a”.</p>
   <p class="maintext">Exchange the words for water and to drink into Ceron</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><b>Maha</b></p>
   <p class="maintext67">Water (Only drinking water)</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><b>Bod</b></p>
   <p class="maintext67">To drink</p>
   <p class="maintext">The sentence would now look like this</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ymaha abod</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm drinking water / I drink water</p>
   <p class="maintext">And if the noun would have ended with a consonant, it would look like this</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><b>Haber</b></p>
   <p class="maintext67">Book</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><b>Habon</b></p>
   <p class="maintext67">To read</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Yhabera habon</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm reading a book / I read book</p>
   <p class="maintext">(See how the “a” is attached onto the end of the noun instead of at the front of the verb)
   <p class="maintext">If a noun ends with a vowel, and the verb preceding it starts with a vowel aswell, the “a” is attached to the end of the noun with the vowel, and the ending is changed appropriately. For example</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ydunadwa apena </i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm taking focus of the moment (Ydundu-a apena)</p>
   <p class="maintext">When using NP verbs, nothing must be added</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Yedas</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm thinking</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ycomad</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm looking</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ybon</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I live / I'm living</p>
   <p class="maintext">If you haven't realized already, Ceron does not differentiate between present progressive and the present tense. (Ex. Walk vs walking)</p>
   <p class="maintextU" id="section-2">“a” and “a sa”</p>
   <p class="maintextU" >“a” as an adposition</p>
   <p class="maintext">So… “a” again… but as an adposition! (preposition for simplicity). The adposition “a” can have a plethora of meanings in Ceron, although the most important one, and the one I will be focusing on, is its function as “at” or “in” in English. Generally speaking, the particle “a” can be replaced exactly with the prepositions “at” or “in” in English. Take a look at these English sentences featuring the prepositions “at” and “in” for a better understanding. This case is technically called the locative case.</p>
   <p class="maintext">I'm at (the) house.</p>
   <p class="maintext">I'm at school.</p>
   <p class="maintext">I'm at (the) train station.</p>
   <p class="maintext">I'm in (the) bathroom.</p>
   <p class="maintext">In all these sentences, the Ceronec adposition “a” would be interchangeable with the English prepositions “at” or “in” (Of course, after the noun, not before, hence adposition). Thankfully, nothing has to be done in order to connect these adpositions to nouns, although, one small difference we see, is that the adposition “a”, is connected to a noun without a space.</p>
   <p class="maintext">Translate the words</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><b>Sacon</b></p>
   <p class="maintext67">School</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><b>Labanmar</b></p>
   <p class="maintext67">Train Station</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><b>Bason</b></p>
   <p class="maintext67">Bathroom</p>
   <p class="maintext">Now, here are those same sentences in Ceron, with the adposition “a” highlighted in blue</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ymamona</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm at the house</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ysacona</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm at school</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ylabanmara</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm at the train station</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ybasona</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm in the bathroom</p>
   <p class="maintext">Notice how just like when we were linking verbs to objects, the adposition “a” connects directly onto the end of the noun without a space. Also, from now on, I will be referring to adpositions as prepositions for simplicity reasons. Remember that if a word ends with a vowel, the ending is changed depending on the type of vowel it ends with; for example,</p>
   <p class="maintext">The vowels “u” and “o” turn into “wa” when the vowel “a” is supposed to be attached onto the end of them.
     <p class="maintext87"><i>Ywa</i></p>
     <p class="maintext67">I am at you (Y-u-a)</p>
     <p class="maintext87"><i>Ygagwa</i></p>
     <p class="maintext67">I am at the bush (Y-gago-a)</p>
   <p class="maintext">The vowel “e” turns into “ya” when encountered with the vowel “a” at the end of it</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Yya</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I am at the tower (Y-e-a)</p>
   <p class="maintext">Nothing happens with the vowel “a”, a double “a” is not needed (although usally “a” turns into “ya” at the end of words)</p>
   <p class="maintext">Let’s combine all of the concepts we’ve learned so far into sentences!</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ysa mamona gonrun</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm studying at the big house</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ysharona sacona maha abod</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm drinking water at the nice school</p>
    <p class="maintext87"><i>Ybya basona marasa abuden</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm talking to my friend in the quiet bathroom</p>
   <p class="maintextU">“a” as something that doesnt exist in English</p>
   <p class="maintext">Look at these English sentences and pay close attention to their composition</p>
   <p class="maintext87">I'm opening the window</p>
   <p class="maintext87">I'm touching the person</p>
   <p class="maintext87">I'm looking at the dog</p>
   <p class="maintext87">I'm talking to the person</p>
   <p class="maintext">Notice how in all these sentences, you’re doing the verb to the noun. Now, the last two sentences are the clearest examples of this “doing the verb to the noun”. See how in the sentence “Im looking at the dog” the preposition “at” is present, signifying that you are “doing the looking to the dog”. In English, it's not always necessary to specify this “doing the verb to the noun”, for example, in the sentence “I’m touching the person”, no preposition such as “to” or “at” is present, yet in Ceron, that same sentence would be “I’m person at/to touching”. In Ceron, it is compulsory to always indicate that the noun is the subject of an action when saying sentences like these.</p>
   <p class="maintext87">I'm opening the window</p>
   <p class="maintext87">I'm touching the person</p>
   <p class="maintext">is</p>
   <p class="maintext87">I'm opening at/to the window</p>
   <p class="maintext87">I'm touching at/to the person</p>
   <p class="maintext">This concept can be quite confusing to fully grasp since you might be wondering, “When do you indicate that the noun is the recipient of a verb?” For example, why in the sentence “I drink water” (E maha a bod) is it not indicated that water (maha) is the recipient of the verb. Generally speaking, verbs in Ceron can be divided into two more separate categories (aside from P and NP) and that is that some verbs are Forceful (F) and some verbs are Passive (P). When a verb is F, you must attach the particle “a” after the noun to indicate that it is the recipient of the verb, regardless if it is P or NP. If a verb is P, you do not need to indicate that the noun is the recipient of the verb (Usually, some exceptions for when you are specifically doing said action to a thing). Knowing whether a verb is F or P is impossible, and is completely irregular. Since the method of forming this grammar concept is the same as the method for linking nouns to P verbs, you will oftentimes see NP verbs with the particle “a” in front of them (indicating this grammar concept, not the linking concept), which might be confusing at first.</p>
   <p class="maintext">Now enough rambling! Let me show you how to actually form this grammar principle. To form this “form” all you need to do is add the particle (not the preposition) “a” after the noun but before the verb. You always have to attach “a” directly to the end of the noun expect for when the noun ends with a vowel. Also, when this form is used alongside a P verb, there would naturally be a double “a” (One representing the P verb and one representing a F verb) but to avoid redundancy, one “a” is deleted and so only one is left in the sentence.</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ymunura cems</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm opening the door / LIT: I door AT open</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Dena mamona comad</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">The person is looking at the house / LIT: Person house AT look</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ymunura sonus</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm touching the door / LIT: I door AT touch</p>
   <p class="maintext">You only use this form when you want to explicitly state that a verb is being done to an object, and so in theory, any verb can become a F verb, although it's extremely unnatural to use this form with verbs that are already “obvious”. You can also only use this form in the present tense. I honestly cannot explain which verbs need this form, and I cannot explain when you should use it, you just need to learn from exposure and practice. (If someone knows what this is actually called grammatically please let me know).</p>
   <p class="maintext">*Both these verbs are NP verbs, and so normally they should not have the particle “a” before them, which usally denotes Physicality. In this situation though, the “a” is representing the fact that we are doing said verb to said object explicitly. Remember not to confuse these two functions up.</p>
   <p class="maintext">I just recently discovered that this case is actually called the accusative case! This section can be better explained in lesson X, click here to read it</p>
   <p class="maintextU" id="section-3">More on “a sa”</p>
   <p class="maintext">Previously, I showed that “a” can denote the location where a subject is doing an action. (Similar to “at” in English), well, how do you describe a situation where you are going somewhere while doing an action? Similar to “to” in English? (Locative and Dative case). This is where “a sa” comes into play. Take a look at these English sentences</p>
   <p class="maintext87">I'm going home</p>
   <p class="maintext87">I'm walking home</p>
   <p class="maintext87">I'm traveling to Canada</p>
   <p class="maintext">Once again, English loves to have irregular rules, and so in the first two sentences, the preposition “to” is not present despite the sentences describing a scenario where you are going in the direction of a place. In the last sentence, however, “Im traveling to Canada”, the preposition “to” is prevalent, and this is how you would treat any sentence in Ceron where you are expressing motion in the direction of a place. Now, knowing this, you might be tempted to say something like this</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ymamon a caumen</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm walking home</p>
   <p class="maintext">But this is completely incorrect! Whenever you are doing the motion of going somewhere, you have to use the preposition “a sa”. That above sentence actually means “I am walking at/in home”, which is the almost complete opposite of what we are trying to say. Here are those same 3 sentences translated correctly. Remember that “a sa” gets attached directly to the word its modifying without a space. If the word ends with an “a” only include “sa”, and when this happens, attach the “sa” directly onto the end of the word, without a space (as in the last two example sentences)</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ymamona sa</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm going home</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ymamona sa caumen</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm walking home</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ycanadasa aren</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm traveling to Canada</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ygagwasa abyacer</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm sneaking towards the bush </p>
   <p class="maintext">*When “a sa” appears on its own at the end of a sentence, it means “to go”</p>
   <p class="maintextU">Second Meaning of “a sa” / “sa” </p>
   <p class="maintext">Earlier, you may have noticed the sentence “E basona marasa a buden” which includes the grammar particle we just learned, “a sa”. However in that example, “a sa”, which is actually “asa” takes on a completely different meaning and role. Before I get down into the details of this though, we need to trace our steps a little, remember how before we used the particle “a”, to describe the action of “looking at” or “talking to things?” For example</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Dena mamona comad</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">The person is looking at the house</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ysharona munura abuden</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm talking to the pretty door</p>
   <p class="maintext">However if you pay close attention to all the examples I gave, you would notice that I never included sentences like “I’m looking at the dog” or “I’m talking to my friend” while using the particle “a”. Why is that you ask? In both these sentences, the object/recepient receiving the verb, is a living thing, (dog and friend.) When you talk, listen, look, or do anything else to a living thing, you must use the particle/preposition “asa” not “a” which is used only with inanimate objects. This is called the Dative Case, and in English is translated as “to”. Here are some examples in proper sentences</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ymarasa abuden</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm talking to (my) friend</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ygalasa comad</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm looking at the dog</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Nemaru repa denasa asonus</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm touching my friends muscular body</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ythanasa aysa</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I love him</p>
   <p class="maintext">Notice how in the last sentence, “I love him”, in Ceron, we use “asa” since we are doing something to someone, we are doing the loving to him / “him” is the recipient of the love. It is never acceptable to leave out “asa” when you do something to someone. (Even if the context makes it obvious)</p>
   <p class="maintext">Remember that when a word ends with the letter “a”, only “sa” is used, and it is attached directly onto the end of said word without a space</p>
   <p class="maintext">Simple right? Now, how would we create a sentence like “The dog looks at me” instead of “I look at the dog” in Ceron? In English, we just flip the word order, and the pronoun “I” changes to “me”. With that logic, that sentence would be </p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Gala yasa comad</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">The dog is looking at me</p>
   <p class="maintext">However this is incorrect. In Ceron, we don't just flip the word order in order to change the meaning, Instead, we switch the placement of “a sa” in a sentence, which, in my opinion is quite simple to do and more logical. Here are those two sentences, but in their correct form.</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Ygalasa comad</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">I'm looking at the dog</p>
   <p class="maintext87"><i>Yasa gala comad</i></p>
   <p class="maintext67">The dog is looking at me</p>
   <p class="maintext">The absolute rule is that “a sa” is always connected to the recipient, the person on the receiving end. That being said, the pronoun E (I) can never go anywhere in a sentence except for the first position. I also realized that I didn't quite explain how to express the act of doing something to something that is an inanimate object. In cases like that, you just use the marker “a” which attaches to the end of the word without a space (unless of course it's a vowel). I also want to mention a quick vocab note, the word “dena” has many meanings, for example, it can mean man, male, person, body, human as well as creature.</p>
